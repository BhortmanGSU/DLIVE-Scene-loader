# DLIVE-Scene-loader
  This is a script I made to load scenes on our Allen and Heath DLive

# Requirements 
1: You must have Allen and Heath MIDI Control installed: https://www.allen-heath.com/hardware/controllers/midi-control/resources/
   I would install it to run on startup. You'll select your device, the protocol is MIDI thru, and connect. It should connect at startup from now on. 

2: Python 3.11

3: Install mido   pip install mido

# To do
  Figure out how to conect directly to the console
